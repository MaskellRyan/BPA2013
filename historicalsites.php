In 1874, he and his wife Caroline broke ground on the double lot on the west side of North Delaware Street. This home has served many purposes over the years and stands as a reminder of the goals and values held by our former President throughout his life and career.

					Originally built by architect D.A. Bohlen in 1864 for John Morris, the son of an Indianapolis settler. Financial difficulties in the 1870's required the sale of the home to Noble Butler where it stayed in his lineage until his daughter, Florence Butler passed away in 1957.
					</p><p>
					Throughout the years this house has served the poor and those suffering from neglect as a place of refuge until it was purchased by Eli Lilly, a well known philanthropist, in 1964. Lilly acquired the home when it was in danger of being demolished to paved way for the new Interstate 70. The house was reopened to the public in 1969 after major restoration work, including repairing the warped wooden floors, cleaning and restoring the aging brickwork and adding a new slate roof. 
					</p><p>
					The Morris-Butler House continues in its ongoing restoration projects while offering daily tours and hosting cultural and educational events.

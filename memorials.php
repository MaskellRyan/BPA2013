				<p>Sitting between the federal building and the public library stands the Indiana War Memorial. The World War I memorial sparked the City Beautiful movement with its Neo-Classical columns and limestone walls. </p>
				<p>Construction of the monument started in 1926 and continued until its final completion in 1965. The memorials design is based upon the mausoleum of Halicarnassus, which happens to be one of the seven wonders of the world. The monument is easily recognizable with its height of 210 feet and the blue lights that shine between the columns on its side. </p>
				<p>Complete with symbolic statues representing Courage, Memory, Peace, Victory,
				Liberty and Patriotism the monument is an icon representation of Indianapolis and her rich history. </p>

				<p>The world's first operational atomic bomb was delivered by the USS Indianapolis (CA-35) to the island of Tinian on July 26, 1945. Four days later a Japanese submarine fired six torpedoes, two of which hit and sunk the US ship.</p>

				<p>Out of the nearly 1200 men that were aboard, about 900 made it out of the sinking ship but throughout the five day rescue only 317 survived the wait of being found while they waded through shark infested waters. </p>
				<p>This memorial serves as a reminder for those that served our country. Dedicated to the lives lost by those who remained after the ship went down. This memorial is available for public viewing 24 hours a day, seven days a week and includes the names over everyone that was aboard the USS Indianapolis on that fateful day. </p>

				<p>The unveiling of the Landmark for Peace Memorial on September 30, 1995, drew
				nearly 3,000 citizens. This memorial was the brain child of politico, Larry Conrad. He
				envisioned a joint memorial for the slain leaders Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert
				F. Kennedy. </p>
				<p>The two men were tied together on April 4, 1968, near the eventual site of the
				memorial, when Kennedy gave an impromptu speech to a willing crowd about the
				reconciliation between races after he learned of Dr. King's assassination.</p>
				<p>The landmark features the figures of both men reaching out to each other rendered in
				bronze sculpture. </p>

				<p>Lockerbie Square is the oldest surviving neighborhood in Indianapolis. Visitors to
				Lockerbie Square are provided a glimpse into the neighborhood that boasted
				cottages and high-brick buildings that were once homes to many of the first
				immigrants to settle there.</p>

				<p>A few of notable families, like the Lockerbie's, to which the neighborhood gets its
				name built the buildings that at one time attracted local artisans, clerks, and laborers
				who established the charm and character that draw so many civic minded people to
				the square today.</p>

				<p>Words spoken to the audience of the 1927 grand opening of the Madame Walker
				Theatre by the then general manager F.B. Ransom still ring true today,
				 </p>
				 <blockquote>
				 “To those who toil, to those who think. . .to those who love good music, good
				 pictures, high class entertainment amidst magnificent surroundings; to those who
				 believe that our boys and girls are entitled to the best there is. . . to all classes;
				 to all races, this house is dedicated.”
				 </blockquote>	
				<p>The brainchild of the first-made female millionaire in America, Madame C.J.
				Walker began the development of the Walker and Theatre building prior to her
				death in 1919. Throughout its nearly 100 year history and restoration the
				Madame Walker Theatre Center building has served the community though arts
				and culture.</p>

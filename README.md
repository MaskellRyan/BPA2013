INDY a History
=======

This website was developed by Ryan Maskell, Designed by Ashley Chaffin, and Written by Hannah Shields.

The Business Professionals of America national competition in Orlando FL 2013 awarded this site with 3rd place.

The prompt for the idea of this site was to create a website that would give information about the history of Indianapolis and its surrounding suburbs. We took it to the next level and gave a very visual representation of it so that it would be fun to learn about the city.

This site was written with HTML5 semantics, CSS3, SASS, and leveraged a fluid responsive layout built custom by Ryan Maskell.
